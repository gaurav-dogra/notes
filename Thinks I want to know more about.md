```powershell
Install-Package Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.UserSecrets

```

*Note: The UserSecrets package contains Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json already, so you donâ€™t need to add it separately.*

- Right-click on the project > click **Manage User Secrets**.
- This creates the secrets.json file and opens it.
- Now can you override the connection string from appsettings by putting it in secrets.json:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Default": "Server=SQL_SERVER_INSTANCE_NAME;Database=StreamingService;Integrated Security=true"
  }
}

```
